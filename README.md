### Overview 
> This repository is part of the ALX low level programming where I try to solve each task with the help of google searches and provided resources to achieve required solutions.

- [0x00-hello_world](https://github.com/Arnoldmn/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-hello_world): Here we looked at the hello world project as we tried to get familiar with the basics of C.
- [0x01-variables_if_else_while](https://github.com/Arnoldmn/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-variables_if_else_while): In this particualr project we took time to look at control statements in C.
- [0x02-functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/Arnoldmn/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-functions_nested_loops): As for this one we spent time looking at how functions and loops work in C. 
- [0x04-more_functions_nested_loops](https://github.com/Arnoldmn/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x04-more_functions_nested_loops): We continued working with loops and functions in C but more advanced topics.
- [0x05-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/Arnoldmn/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x05-pointers_arrays_strings): As for this project we left our comfort zone and went deep in the into C by trying to understand what are Arrays and pointers.
- [0x06-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/Arnoldmn/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x06-pointers_arrays_strings): We went deep into the topics by trying to solve more hard questions and tasks.
- [0x07-pointers_arrays_strings](https://github.com/Arnoldmn/alx-low_level_programming/tree/master/0x07-pointers_arrays_strings): we went deep into the Valleys the Himalayas with pointers and arrays.
